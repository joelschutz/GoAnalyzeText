# Go Analyze Text

A simple Go project to expetiment with the language. I'm just starting, please don't judge me. :upside_down_face:

## Usage

Simply write anything in a txt file as run the script as:

```bash
go run main.go <name-of-my-file>.txt
```

For now it will print a struct with some info about the text in the file.

Be aware that it may change in the future.
